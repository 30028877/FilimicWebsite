                    If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personal information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
                    <br />

                    If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy, depends on the information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

                    <br />
                    You have given us permission to do so
                    <br />
                    The processing is in our legitimate interests and it's not overridden by your rights
                    <br />
                    For payment processing purposes
                    <br />
                    To comply with the law
                    <br />
                    If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    The right of restriction
                    <br />
                    The right to data portability
                    <br />
                    The right to withdraw consent
                    <br />
                    Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.
                    <br />

                    You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA).

                    Service Providers
                    <br />

                    We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Website ("Service Providers"), to provide our Website on our behalf, to perform Website-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Website is used.

                    Analytics
                    <br />

                    Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
                    <br />

                    You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    We will not store or collect your payment card details.
